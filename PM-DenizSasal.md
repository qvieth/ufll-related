## Big picture & terminology

All aspect of project management: project life cycle, process group, knowledge areas, WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), scheduling, cost
> Project management is complementary discipline that helps you run your projects very easily 

- A framework for project management that you can implement it at work
- This video is for you if you're preparing for your __PMP__ (Project menagement professional) exam
- PMBOK guide : Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
- Project : a temporary endeavor to create a unique solution : same as operations
- The difference between project and operations is simple: a project ends, so it's temporary
- You implement your project, you close it, you create a unique product/service/ or whatever the outcome you wanted then you are done
- Whereas in operations, it's on going and repetive.

- Program: multiple project put together, combined
- Portfolio: multiple program put together

## Project = Project Life Cycle + Project Management Process
To run any project, you need 2 methodologies:
1. Project life cycle
2. Project management process (Process Groups)
> You can not confuse a project life cycle and project management process

__The PLC describes the steps (phases) from the start of the project to the end; the PGâ€™s describe what happens within each step (phase) of the PLC.__

### Project life cycle (4:43)
- Is unique to a project to an industry, to your needs
- It's highly customizable : think of this : a human development is a project : so your life cycle is :
    1. Conceiving
    1. Birth
    1. Childhood
    1. Teenaging
    1. Adulthood
    1. Dead
- Project life cycle of an IT project
    1. High level design
    1. Detailed design
    1. Coding
    1. Testing
    1. Installation
    1. Turnover
> This is project life __cycle__ : the term cycle that is where confusing : it's a sequential steps of various phases of a project, and these phaeses are unique to your own projects and your needs, it means you create these cycle

> There is no single way to define the ideal structure for a project
, for example: one company may treat a feasibility study as first phase of a project, another may treat that as a third phase, it's __customize__

### Project Management process (Process group) (6:52)
See, if you're following PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge, then your process groups aren't quite customizable, so you can customize the processes, but not the groups
So we have 5 process groups to learn here, we have:
1. Initiation
2. Planning
3. Executing
4. Monitoring & controling
5. Closing

> Now here's where all the confusion arises:
For those of you, who are interested in taking a PMP test,
I will now tell you the single biggest reason why most test taker fail,
And it's all because of confusing this,
This is what iam about to share:
Remember how we talked about the fact that Project Life Cycle is highly customizable?,
Now what we do in real life is,
For small projects we simplify things
Now what we do in real life is, for small projects we simplify things.
Instead of attaching process groups to every single phase __of__ the project life cycle,
In real life, we just attach the process groups to a __single phase project life cycle__

This make things really easy to run the project for us, less complication
, I mean why make more thing more complicated than they should be right, there's a lot of paperwork\
__If you dont get this guide, i guarantee you will fail the exam__\
(9:15) 
Now we are going to talk about the process groups, and while i'm explaining that, i will also run a project for you to demonstate
> but before i get there, i want to share something very quickly with you:
It's about PMP, if you're looking to get a PMP degree so you can advance in your career and get better jobs, don't. DON'T DO THAT
It won't really help you as much as you think
Because most multinational firms have their in-house methodology to follow, so you will have to unlearn lot of things to learn their way
Alot of better than PMI's framework or prince 2 methodology
But still, learn the fundamentals, learn everything i'll share in this video, PROJECT MANAGEMENT is awesome, but certificate.. not so much

#### Initiation - process groups (11:57)
For initiation process group, you have 2 important processes:
##### Project Charter development
- A fairly simple document, outlining a few things
- It's like mini project plan, very simple one though
- Essentially, you are finding an answer to; why you are doing what you are doing
- So in my case, if i have to develop a __Project Charter__ for building this boat, it would be include: my __objective, scope, rough idea for the cost and time, key stakeholders and milestones.__
- At the initiation stage, you don't want the document to be very detailed
- So, in your case, your project charter may be as simple as explaining why you consider the expansion to foreign markets, why you are considering building that new factory(repeat one more, this is not the time to go into huge details)
- Talk about business case and maybe __high level objectives__, major deliverables, and the roles and responsibilities
> SO HERE'S THE QUESTION: why do this __Project Charter__ if it's not detailed? : Planning is no easy task, planning is difficult, so it's a great opportunity for your senior leadership to kill the project early on before you spend so much time planning a project that will just end up being a __waste__. It's like a proposal of should we go ahead with this project.
##### Stakeholder identification
- At this stage, you will again keep it very simple, you will not categorize all the stakeholders based on their influence and power, you'll do that later in planning
- Now at i mentioned before, we just want to know if we should proceed or not it's a checkpoint
- So all you do is, create an excel list and list down various stakeholders that you will engage with
- In my case, my stakeholder will be : my wife, she'll be my sponsor; then my neighbors because i'll do a lot of hammering, and drilling, so i'll make a lot of noise, therefor, i need to include them as my stakeholders
- For most projects, your primary stakeholder is your project sponsor.
- Who gives you sponsor, who gives you the go or no-go? Who is the project manager? Who are going to be part of the project team? Who are going to be part of project management team?
- Project management team is different than project team
- Ok now we have the __project charter__ and __project stakeholder register__  we can move on to __planning__, of course provided that you secure the approvals.

---
Now we have initiated the project, we got our approvals, and it's time to plan it:
#### Planning - process groups (18:22)
__planing__ is a lot more __detailed__ and __comprehensive__ than __initiation__
- We need to talk about a lot of detail and knowledge areas
- So with planning we are looking to find answer to 3 main question
    1. What are we going to do?
    2. How are we going to do it?
    3. How to know when the project is done? This particular one is really important, because in real life most projects are never done, they almost become operations, they're never done

At the end of the __planning process__, you'll end up with a comprehensive __Project Plan__
And this __project plan__ will include a few items;
So it'll include: requirements, scope, WBS(Work Breakdown Structure),schedule(some form of a timelines), then we'll have cost & budget, and quality
> For those PMP takers, let me put a disclaimer here. The PMBOK guide includes more processes with their 500 pages, it has a vast majority knowledge area, but i'm simplify things for you here. So if you're planning on taking the test, just make sure you'll properly read the whole thing

So let's keep going:
##### Collecting requirements
- __The first process__ we have is __collecting requirements__, understand what stakeholders want: I mean we wrote this in __Project Charter__ right, so what we're gonna do is we just take this __Project Charter__ and give we more detail and specifications
- This isn't the easy task in real life: i mean collecting requirements is the easiest part, but the difficult part is maintaining your sanity.
- Because the moment you start gathering requirements, then everybody is going to want to have the best of everything without consideration for budget, quality, or schedule, and they'll have contradicting requirements, there will be clashes.
- And especially at this stage, you don't even know the budget or quality or schedule, so you need to somehow gather the requirements based on your assumptions : and that's no easy task
- If my wife comes up to me and says: let's buy a new car, i'm gonna say i want Porsche 911 GT3, i won't consider the family budget, or maintenace expenses. I'll just say what i want
- That's how it is in project management as well : when you ask what your stakeholders want, they'll shoot for the moon, they want the best.
- So, as a project manager, you have to keep thing on the leash and explain people that : __there are always trade-offs in life__
- Just a small tips here, when you're collecting requirements, there are so many methods available to you : you can do 1 on 1 interviews, you can apply Delphi technique, you can do nominal group technique or other methods(those with fancy names)
- If you ask me and if you can, just stick to a good ol' meeting, just get everyone in a room or on a teleconference and gather the requirements collectively
- If you do interviews 1 by 1, then you'll have a lot of contradicting requirements at your hand right. Get everyone together, get them argue, let them fight, but the end you'll have your requirements __set in stone__

##### Defining the Scope
- __Next process__ is __Defining the Scope__
- So the scope, what does scope do: it makes you see sort of things clear but then exclude other things right? That's exactly what it is, in project management as well 
- To do the project scope we need a few documents, we need __project charter__ and then we need project requirements, and then any riskis, assumptions, and constraint to define the scope
- Now define the scope is one of the most important processes because what happen in reality is weak project manager include everything in project requirement documents or make it very vague, also in the project scope, so as a result your project plant just becomes an impossible plan to execute because your scope go into your project plan.
- So if you're doing a weak job setting your scope, or if you're really vague then you're not really able to execute it.
- Try not to go overboard, make things very clear
- Your project scope statement should or may include your project scope and then your deleverables, your project justifications, your business case and success criteria,

##### Scope baseline (Scope statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary & Scope Creep)
Now we're done with project scope, let me introduce you __Scope baseline__: composed of 3 things:
1. Scope statement
2. __WBS__ (you can't afford to misunderstand WBS)
3. WBS Dictionary
> You can afford to misunderstand WBS, it is very important, whatever project methodologies or framworks you use, this is essential, __very very important__ 

###### Scope statement
So, before I start creating a WBS for the boat project, let me tell you what it is:
- The WBS break the project down into smaller and more manageable pieces, it's a top-down effort
- You basically just decompose your deliverables and then we call them Work Packages
> I want to highlight one more really important thing here: if you strictly follow PMI's framework, then work Packages have to be "things", they can't be actions, they need to be deliverables, they are complicated things\
In practice though, this isn't usually how things are done, most people use a hybrid model, their Work Breakdown Structure contains, deliverables, but also even tasks, so if you're not taking the test, then just use whatever you want, whatever fit your needs\
Here's the question: can you confidently estimate the __cost__ and __time__ requirements of that work package, can you say it's 1 week or 1000 dollars, can you answer that questions?\
If you can't then you need to break it down further to activity level until you can make __cost__ and __time__ assumptions\
For example, when I look at this boat, I can't say how long it will take to finish it, but i can estimate how long it will take to __laminate__ it, or do the wood work,etc\
So go as deep as you need to go and roll up and estimate the __cost__ and the __time__, but that's for later

###### WBS
So let's do it, let's do the __WBS__ (27:43)
...
I want to talk about the importance of the document once more:
- Everything happens after WBS in our __planning process group__ is directly related to __WBS__
- For example: project costs, schedule, risks, everything is caculated by using this chart
- We do not calculate the costs or the schedule for a project as a whole
- We do that at __work package__ level using the __WBS__

###### WBS Dictionary & Scope Creep
Now let's come to __WBS Dictionary__
- Imagine this, if we don't define these work packages properly, then we are __prone__ to a __scope creep__
- Now what is a scope creep, it is basically, scope extending its boundaries
- Remember the porsche 911 gt3 that i wanted from my wife
- So that prosche 911 gt3 becomes gt3 rs - basically a higher model
- So if you don't control and keep the leash, scope keeps on expanding
- Your stakeholders will always push you to do more by stretching your scope
- So as a project manager, you have to prevent it, what you do is you create a __dictionary__, __for every single WBS item__
- So you put boundaries around it, explain it, by that way, nobody can stretch it
- Especially in the planning stage, because once the planning is over, you have to execute it

Let's go back to WBS, continue the __time management__, the __schedule__
- We start giving estimate for how long a particular work package will take
- Here's an important point for you : if you can't confidently estimate how long a work package will take to complete, then you need to breakdown your WBS further to acitivity level
- Once you done estimating these, the other fun part starts, and that's putting them in a sequence.
- Now for PMP takers, you need to resort to PMBOK guide for boring details of Finish to start, start to finish, and calculation of critical part with MS projects
- But for the rest of you, you don't need to do it with MS projects, cause i'm showing you the a lot of easier way
- So in practice, we do all of those with the help of MS projects, __MS projects__ is very easy and it's an awesome program, but you don't even need __MS projects__ for most of your projects

###### Ganttchart
- All you need at this stage is a __Gantt Chart__ : a very easy to use, it makes things so simple
- It very easy to list your activities or work packages in a suitable time scale
- Each work package or activity is represented by a bar and the position and length of the bar
- You can use ms projects, ms exel or even manually on a powerpoint if you want to, it really depends on how complex your project is

##### Fast Tracking & Project Crashing & Cost Management
3 things that you'll here a lot:
1. __Fast tracking__ : fast tracking a project means performing more activities in parallel: so you'll see more bars along same vertical axis
2. __Project crashing__ : shortening the durations of activities by adding more resources, for example : if 2 workers finish the work in 30 days, then how long does it takes for 4 workers to finish it? this is called __project crashing__, but it come with a cost right, cost of additional resources, additional money
you've probably seen those huge towers being built in china in 30 days right? this is what they do, they just crashed every single __work package__, because they don't have the labor shortage, and properly no money shortage either, so that's how they do it
3. __Cost management__

#### Executing Process Group (41:05)
The process of executing process is to complete work we defined in the __project management plan__ and meet the __project objectives__, this is where we __do the work__. Your job is essentially guiding the team to stick to the plan you created. If you have done good job with __planning__, executing is the easiest part.\
Although it takes the longest, as much as 10 times more time you spent on planning, it's the __easiest__ part, it's like playing with lego.
But if you haven't done a good job with the plan, then the execution will be a nightmare

##### Gold Plating
- So, in execution, if you are not  the one doing all the execution work, there are a few things you need to be doing constantly, for example: you need to constantly mange the expectations of all stakeholders, you need to protect your scope, cause you'll quicly realize that stakeholders will want you to __gold plate__
- __Gold Plate__ in simple terms : making changes to a project that are outside of your scope
- You know : instead of getting grade B quality material as you agreed, your stakeholders now want you to get grade A quality, now this is a problem because you didn't factor that in your budget or time estimates.
- So as a project manager you need to prevent __scope creep__, protect your __scope__, your __scope__ is like a national flag, you protect it against __all unnecessary change requests__

#### M&C Process Group (43:20)
__Monitoring and controlling__ means measuring the performance of your project against the plan, manage you change request so making sure you're hitting your KPIs, if you've included them in the plan. __An important aspect here, monitoring and controlling starts with the execution process group. So, they run in parallel.__
So you __monitor and control__ "__when__" you are already executing it : it make sense right, how can you manage once you finish the execution, it's common sense
. So what do you monitor and controll then?:
- You monitor your scope, you make sure no __scope creep__ happens, you monitor your schedule and forecast if you think there'll be delays
- This is particularly easy to see because you already have your project time plan, project schedule, remember we even put it on the __Gantt Chart__, then you'll monitor your cost, quality, your risks and your __procurement__, is __procurement__ happening alright, is the procurement happening alright?
- Again this is fairly simple, for example you finished a particular work package, you can just always look back and verify if you were within the allowance, if you weren't then you look for the root causes, what happened? why did we exceed the budget or the schedule
- Then obivously you solve those problem so they won't repeat, and you make sure you document everything

##### Earned Value
- For PMP takers, please pay extra attention to __Earned Value Calculations__, it becomes particularly important in this stage
- Now i want to quickly touch on __Earn Value__ here : [__Earn Value__ = project budget X % complete of the project]

#### Closing Process Group (48:01)
Now we __finished__ the product. But, is the project finished? The product is finished, but the project, no it's not. There' still some work to be done. Mostly boring admin work:
- Well what you do is really customizable to the needs and complexity of your project
- But in general, these are good starting points:
    1. We hand it over to the client if it's a project you did for a client, you need to basically get a sign-off from the client.
    2. Finish procurements: meaning, you need to make the final payments and complete your cost records
    3. Gather your final lessons learned, this is basically documenting what went wrong and what did we learn from it. you properly can't see it on the camera, but this boat isn't perfect
    4. You release resources, let your team members go back to their own teams
    5. Go celebrate
